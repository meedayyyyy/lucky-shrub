# About Project

Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping.
I enjoyed working on this project so much as I got to design the homepage from scratch, selected the colors and fonts and customized the illustrations to match the theme I chose. 
This is a *responsive web design* project.
